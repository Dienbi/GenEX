## 🎯 What Was Built

### Two Leaderboards Display

**1. 🔥 Top Current Streaks**
- Shows top 10 users with **active streaks** (current_streak > 0)
- Sorted by: current_streak (DESC), then last_quiz_date (DESC)
- Real-time rankings of who's on fire right now!

**2. 🏆 Top Longest Streaks**
- Shows top 10 users with **all-time best streaks** (longest_streak > 0)
- Sorted by: longest_streak (DESC), then current_streak (DESC)
- Hall of fame - greatest achievements ever!

---

## 🎨 UI Features

### Visual Design
- **Two side-by-side cards** (responsive grid)
- **Gradient headers**:
  - Current: Orange gradient 🔥
  - Longest: Gold gradient 🏆
- **Medal system**: 
  - 🥇 Gold for #1
  - 🥈 Silver for #2
  - 🥉 Bronze for #3
  - Numbers for #4-10

### User Highlighting
- **Your username** appears with:
  - 👤 Icon prefix
  - Purple color
  - Bold font
  - Easy to spot yourself!

### Interactive Elements
- **Hover effects**: Items lift on hover
- **Smooth animations**: translateX effect
- **Clean borders**: Separated items
- **Empty states**: Motivational messages when no data

## 📊 Ranking Logic

### Top Current Streaks
```sql
-- Query logic
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE current_streak > 0
ORDER BY current_streak DESC, last_quiz_date DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Tiebreaker**: If two users have same streak, most recent quiz wins

### Top Longest Streaks
```sql
-- Query logic
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE longest_streak > 0
ORDER BY longest_streak DESC, current_streak DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Tiebreaker**: If two users have same longest streak, higher current streak wins
