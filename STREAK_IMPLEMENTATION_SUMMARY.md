---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema ✅
**User Model** (`users/models.py`) - Added 3 fields:
- `current_streak`: Current consecutive days (default: 0)
- `longest_streak`: Personal best ever (default: 0)
- `last_quiz_date`: Last quiz completion timestamp

**Migration**: `users/migrations/0002_*.py` ✅ Applied

### 2. Streak Logic ✅
**File**: `quizzes/streak_utils.py`

**Functions Implemented:**
- `check_and_update_streak(user)` - Auto-reset if 30h+ passed
- `update_streak_on_quiz_completion(user)` - Increment/reset logic
- `get_streak_status_message(streak_info)` - User-friendly messages
- `get_time_until_streak_expires(user)` - Countdown timer

### 3. View Integration ✅

**quiz_home view** - Checks streak on page visit
**submit_quiz_view** - Updates streak after quiz completion

### 4. Beautiful UI ✅

**Streak Display** on `/quizzes/`:
- 🔥 Current Streak card (orange)
- 🏆 Longest Streak card (gold)
- ⏰ Time remaining countdown
- ⚠️ Warning when < 5 hours left
- Motivational messages

---

## 📏 Streak Rules (As Requested)

### ✅ To Maintain Streak:
- Complete a quiz within **30 hours** of last quiz

### ✅ To Increment Streak:
- Complete quiz on **next day** (different date)
- Within 30-hour window
- Multiple quizzes same day = no extra increment

### ❌ Streak Resets When:
- Visit `/quizzes/` after 30+ hours with no quiz
- Automatic, no penalty message

## 🎮 Examples

### Example 1: Perfect Daily Streak
```
Monday 2 PM: Quiz → Streak = 1 🔥
Tuesday 3 PM: Quiz → Streak = 2 🔥
Wednesday 2 PM: Quiz → Streak = 3 🔥
```

### Example 2: Same Day Multiple Quizzes
```
Monday 10 AM: Quiz → Streak = 1
Monday 2 PM: Quiz → Streak = 1 (no increment)
Monday 8 PM: Quiz → Streak = 1 (still no increment)
Tuesday 11 AM: Quiz → Streak = 2 ✅ (next day!)
```

### Example 3: Using 30-Hour Grace Period
```
Monday 11 PM: Quiz → Streak = 1
Wednesday 4 AM: Quiz → Streak = 2 ✅ (29h later, different day)
```

### Example 4: Streak Break
```
Monday 3 PM: Quiz → Streak = 1
[33 hours pass - no quiz]
Wednesday: Visit /quizzes/ → Streak = 0 (auto-reset)
Wednesday: Complete quiz → Streak = 1 (new streak)
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### On Page Visit (`/quizzes/`):
1. System checks `last_quiz_date`
2. If 30+ hours passed → Reset `current_streak = 0`
3. Display current & longest streaks
4. Show countdown timer if active

### On Quiz Completion:
1. System checks `last_quiz_date`
2. **Same day?** → Update timestamp only, no increment
3. **Next day + within 30h?** → Increment streak! 🔥
4. **30+ hours passed?** → Reset to 1 (new streak)
5. Update `longest_streak` if needed
6. Show success message
